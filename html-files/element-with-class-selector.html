<p class="highlight">This is P with CLASS="highlight"</p>
<div class="mainpoint highlight">This is the main point of the entire article.
    <!-- see here two classes in div so we can write multiple classes inside the tag with a space between them  -->

<!-- Element with class selector 
here the syntax is 
p.big{
    font-size:20px;
}
here this be read as every p that has a class big 
NOTE: there is no space in p.big if it is it would have completely different meaning
example 
.......
<p class="big">..........</p> here text size would become 20px but
<div class="big">...........</div> this will be un affected as the syntax is for every p not div
.............
Child selector 
here is the syntax
article>p {
color:blue;
}
read it as every p element that is a direct child of an article element(from right to left)
Example 
<article>...
    <p>.......</p> the text here will be blue as this p is direct child of article
</article>
<p>.........</p>this text will not be affected as this is outside the article
<article>
    <div><p>.................</p></div> also this p will also be un affected because this is not the direct child of article
</article>
Descendant selector
here is the syntax
article p{
    color:blue;
}
read it as every p that is inside(at any level) of article 
will be affected
Example 
<article>
    <p>...............</p> this will be text blue
</article>
<p>........</p> this will be un affected as this is not inside any article
<article>
    <div><p>..........</p></div> this will be affected abd text blue this time as opposed to direct child case
</article>
OTHER EXAMPLES OF SUCH COMBINATIONS ARE 
Example 1
.colored p{
    color:blue;
}
 means every p that is inside (at any level) an element with class="colored" will tex color blue
Example 2 
article> .colored {
    color:blue;
}
means every element with class="colored" that is a direct child of article element will have its text colored blue -->
