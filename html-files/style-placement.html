<h2>Subheading 2</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;">I am centered!</p>
<!-- this is the style inside the element so we dont need to target the element because we are inside the element  and can add more styles after semicolons so here the sentence i am centered is text aligned this is called inline styling butttt this is the least preferred method because you have to style different lines by many times through this method -->

SUMMARY 
<!-- placing style inline is great for quick testing but try to avoid if you are coding real website
real sites almost always use external styles sheet and we link back in the external css style sheet this promotes consistent look throughout the site and since we are externalizing css style into one file so each subsequent page will not have to re-download it again and again -->
