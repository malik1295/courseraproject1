<h1>Cascade of CSS Example</h1>
<h2>Subheading 1</h2>
<p>Inheritence allows us to write more global styles on parent elements and then "fine-tune" the styles for some of the child elements as needed. Such approach makes writing CSS very efficient.</p>

<!-- Basic idea is DOM(document object model)
it means if we specify some css property on some element all the children and grand children and so on and so will also inherit that property without u to specify property for each and every elements
EXAMPLE 
if we specify some property on body tag then every  element that is a child of body tag or even child of child of body tag will inherit that property -->
